## 🚀 About The Project

**nkrypt.xyz** is designed from the ground up to be secure by default. We provide "Buckets"—dedicated encryption containers where all your data is encrypted on your device (web or mobile) before it ever touches a server.

### Key Features

- 🔒 **Genuine End-to-End Encryption:** Your keys never leave your device.
- 🤝 **Shareable Containers:** Granular permission controls for sharing specific data.
- 🏠 **Self-Hostable:** Deploy on your local server or cloud provider with our Docker images.
- 🛠 **Programmable & Extensible:** Not just for files—store application data with public/encrypted metadata.
- 📖 **True FOSS:** All source code is published under the **GNU General Public License v3.0**.
